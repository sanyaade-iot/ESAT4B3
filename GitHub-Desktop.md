1. [Install GitHub Desktop](https://help.github.com/desktop/guides/getting-started-with-github-desktop/installing-github-desktop/#platform-mac)
2. [Sign in with GitHub](https://help.github.com/desktop/guides/getting-started-with-github-desktop/authenticating-to-github/#platform-mac)
3. [Clone the repository](https://help.github.com/desktop/guides/contributing-to-projects/cloning-a-repository-from-github-to-github-desktop/#platform-mac)
4. Open Windows Explorer and copy your files to the folder you cloned the repo to in step 3.
5. Go to GitHub Desktop and write a commit message explaining what files you added or changed, what you've done, and why.
6. Commit the changes. Git then saves the changes to your local computer, so that you can go back later.
7. Sync to push the commit to the GitHub servers so other collaborators can see your changes.
8. Regularly pull commits from other collaborators from the server to update your local version with their changes. (Always do this before starting to edit a file!)
